# Module3Project

The data used for this analysis was collected by NCES for the Longitudinal Study of Americas's education system. They interviewed 23000 HS students. 

The data contains over 8000 variables. For the purposes of this study I condensed and consolidated the data points into categories and composites of the more granular original dataset. After cleaning and formatting the data there were XXX variables with XXX entries. I broke them down into these categories. Complete information on the dataset can be found at www.NCES
